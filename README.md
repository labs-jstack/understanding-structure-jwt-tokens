# understanding-structure-jwt-tokens

🔐 This project was developed as part of the course **"Understanding the Structure of JWT Tokens by Building Your Own Implementation"**, with the goal of exploring and applying the fundamental concepts of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a practical way. The core objective is to manually implement the processes of token generation and validation, without relying on external libraries such as jsonwebtoken, providing a deeper understanding of their structure and how they work.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

 - Understand the key characteristics of a JWT, such as being *stateless*, *self-contained* and *language-agnostic*.
 - Learn how a JWT is structured, including its *Header*, *Payload* and *Signature*.
 - Learn how to **sign** and **verify** JWT tokens using *Base64 encoding* and *HMAC-SHA256* encryption, without relying on external libraries.

---

## 📄 Technologies Used

 - **Node.js**
 - **TypeScript**
 - **Crypto** (Node.js native module)
