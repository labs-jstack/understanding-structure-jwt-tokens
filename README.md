# 🔐 Understanding the Structure of JWT Tokens by Building Your Own Implementation

 🧩 This project was developed as part of the **"Understanding the Structure of JWT Tokens by Building Your Own Implementation"** live from the [JStack](https://jstack.com.br/) course. The goal is to explore and apply the fundamental concepts of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a hands-on way. In this project, we manually implement the processes of token generation and validation, without using external libraries like jsonwebtoken.This approach allows for a deeper understanding of how JWTs are structured and how encoding, signing, and verification mechanisms work, providing a solid foundation for using JWTs securely and effectively in real-world applications.

## 🎯 Objectives

 - Understand the key characteristics of a JWT, such as being *stateless*, *self-contained* and *language-agnostic*.
 - Learn how a JWT is structured, including its *Header*, *Payload* and *Signature*.
 - Learn how to **sign** and **verify** JWT tokens using *Base64 encoding* and *HMAC-SHA256* encryption, without relying on external libraries.
